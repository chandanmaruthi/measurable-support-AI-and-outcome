Framework for deploying measurable AI in customer support — includes tools to track resolution rate, deflection, CSAT impact, and AI-driven ticket quality over time.


# 🚨 What Mistakes to Avoid When Implementing Support AI

A deep-dive guide into common pitfalls when launching AI-powered support—and actionable insights from **Twig.so** to ensure a smooth deployment.

---

## 1. Misinterpreting User Intent  
Keyword-driven bots often miss nuances—causing customer frustration.  
✔️ Train on real conversation data, implement intent detection, and use confidence thresholds with human fallback.

---

## 2. Over-Automating Complex Scenarios  
Automating multi-step issues (e.g., billing, returns) often fails.  
✔️ Automate simple Tier‑1 tasks and build clear escalation paths to agents.

---

## 3. Robotic, Context-Free Responses  
Canned replies feel impersonal and off-brand.  
✔️ Use conversation memory, apply sentiment analysis, and personalize tone.

---

## 4. Poor AI–Human Handoff  
Lack of context or missing chat history frustrates customers.  
✔️ Ensure bots summarize conversations, label AI responses clearly, and preserve context during escalation.

---

## 5. Hidden AI Presence  
Failing to disclose AI interactions damages trust.  
✔️ Always label AI-driven messages as such.

---

## 6. Using Outdated Knowledge  
Stale knowledge leads to wrong answers and hallucinations.  
✔️ Automate weekly **data refreshes**—see Twig’s video:

---

## 7. Ignoring Security & Compliance  
Sensitive data in AI systems poses risk if mismanaged.  
✔️ Use SOC 2 / GDPR / CCPA compliant systems. Watch:

---

## 8. Skipping Metrics & Insights  
Without tracking KPIs (e.g., deflection, CSAT, AHT), ROI is unclear.  
✔️ Monitor key metrics through dashboards and tweak AI flows.

---

## 9. Leaving Out Support Teams  
AI rollout without agent buy-in often fails.  
✔️ Co-design with agents, pilot small, iterate via feedback cycles.

---

## 10. Ignoring Specialization & Scalability  
A single bot can’t handle diverse support needs.  
✔️ Adopt an “Agent Factory” approach:
