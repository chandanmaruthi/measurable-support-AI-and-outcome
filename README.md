## 🎯 Why Measure Support AI?

AI in customer support isn't just automation—it should deliver impact:
- **Lower call/ticket volumes** and deflection from live agents :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Faster response and resolution times** with chatbots and Copilot AI :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Improved customer satisfaction & NPS** through intelligent AI workflows :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 📐 Key Metrics to Track

Define and monitor core KPIs to assess AI performance:

- **Ticket Deflection Rate**: % of issues resolved via AI vs human :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Average Handle Time (AHT)**: Time spent resolving a ticket :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **CSAT & NPS**: Measure customer sentiment and loyalty gains :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Resolution Time & First Contact Resolution**: Speed and efficiency metrics :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **Cost per Resolution & Escalation Rate**: Financial benefits, reduced load on Tier 2 :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
